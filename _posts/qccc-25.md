# Overview
Recent years have witnessed significant advances in quantum computing technology, evolving from early demonstrations of quantum supremacy to breakthroughs in error suppression using quantum error correction codes. While early quantum devices struggled with environmental noise and manufacturing imperfections, current research is increasingly emphasizing noise-resilient architectures and systems that integrate quantum accelerators with classical infrastructures. 

The **International Workshop on Quantum Classical Cooperative Computing (QCCC-25)** aims to explore innovative architectural and system-level solutions to enhance quantum computing performance and scalability, particularly through tight integration with classical systems. Topics of interest include hardware/software co-design for quantum-classical systems, quantum error correction, distributed quantum computing architectures, quantum resource management, circuit decomposition, error mitigation, and more. 

**QCCC-25** will bring together researchers from academia, industry, and national labs to discuss and advance next-generation hybrid computing systems. This workshop encourages submission of **2–4 page extended abstracts**, presenting preliminary results or novel ideas in the realm of quantum-classical cooperative computing.

## Venue
**QCCC-25** will be co-located with [ISCA 2025](https://iscaconf.org/2025/) in Kyoto, Japan, on **Saturday, June 21, 2025** (half-day).

## Topics

Topics of interest for this workshop include, but are not limited to:

* Architectural support for quantum-classical cooperative computing
* Quantum classical hybrid algorithms
* Hardware/software co-design for QCCC
* Quantum error correction
* Quantum random access memory
* Architecture for distributed quantum computing
* Quantum resources estimation and management
* Quantum circuit decomposition, integration, and transpilation techniques
* Effective approaches for encoding/decoding classical information into/from quantum state
* Quantum error mitigation
* Variational quantum algorithms (VQA)
* Other QCCC approaches and architectures

Topics that are not relevant include pure quantum or pure classical algorithm/hardware design, and benchmarking of quantum algorithm/devices.
