### Held in conjunction with the The 32nd International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC23')
Orlando, Florida, United States, June 16 - 23, 2023 ([HPDC](https://www.hpdc.org/2023/)), part of ([FCRC](https://fcrc.acm.org/))


### Overview
The past five years have seen tremendous development in quantum computing technology, remarked by the demonstration of quantum supremacy. Although many quantum algorithms declare exponential speedups over their classical counterparts, today's quantum devices in the noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era are very susceptible to environmental noise, internal interference, manufacturing imperfection, and technology limitation. Consequently, quantum algorithms that are more robust to noise, or can be effectively decomposed into small pieces for incremental or parallel quantum execution become promising.  

The purpose of this workshop is to explore innovative ways of quantum-classical cooperative computing (QCCC) to make quantum computing more effective and scalable in NISQ platforms. The workshop will focus heavily on how classical computing can improve NISQ device execution efficiency, scalability, or compensate for noise impact or technology deficiency, with particular emphasis on demonstrable approaches on existing NISQ platforms, such as IBM-Q, IonQ and Rigetti.

### Abstract

In this talk I will provide a new approach to quantum machine learning that involves using classical machine learning to learn a representation for a dataset that can be embedded in a quantum computer.  We will then consider applying this strategy to train a generative model for groundstates of chemistry Hamiltonians that will allow us to predict groundstates given data through a classically learnt representation that converts nuclear positions into weights for a quantum neural network that generates the state.  This work shows that quantum / classical Hybrid methods can be a powerful way to learn how to generate groundstates and potentially even give a cheaper alternative to approximate groundstate preparation than phase estimation provides in some settings.

### Speaker Bio

Nathan Wiebe is a researcher in quantum computing who focuses on quantum methods for machine learning and simulation of physical systems.   His work has provided the first quantum algorithms for deep learning, least squares fitting, quantum simulations using linear-combinations of unitaries, quantum Hamiltonian learning, near-optimal simulation of time-dependent physical systems, efficient Bayesian phase estimation and also has pioneered the use of particle filters for characterizing quantum devices as well as many other contributions ranging from the foundations of thermodynamics to adiabatic quantum computing and quantum chemistry simulation. He received his PhD in 2011 from the university of Calgary studying quantum computing before accepting a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of waterloo and then finally joining Microsoft Research in 2013. In 2019 he left Microsoft to accept a joint appointment at the university of Washington and Pacific Northwest National Labs. He is now an assistant professor in University of Toronto.
