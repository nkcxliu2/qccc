### Held in conjunction with the The 38th ACM International Conference on Supercomputing ([ICS24'](https://ics2024.github.io/index.html))
Kyoto, Japan, June 4 - 7, 2024.


### Overview
The past few years have seen tremendous development in quantum computing technology, remarked by the demonstra- tion of quantum supremacy. Although many quantum algo- rithms declare exponential speedups over their classical coun- terparts, todayâ€™s quantum devices in the noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era are very susceptible to environmen- tal noise, internal interference, manufacturing imperfection, and technology limitations. Consequently, quantum algorithms that are more robust to noise, or can be effectively decomposed into small pieces for incremental or parallel execution on NISQ devices become promising.

The purpose of this workshop is to explore innovative ways of quantum-classical cooperative computing (QCCC) to make quantum computing more effective and scalable in NISQ platforms. The workshop will focus heavily on how classical computing can improve NISQ device execution efficiency, scalability, or compensate for noise impact or technology defi- ciency, with particular emphasis on demonstrable approaches on existing NISQ platforms, such as IBM-Q, IonQ and Rigetti.

## Topics

Topics of interest for this workshop include, but not limited to:

* Quantum classical hybrid algorithms
* Variational quantum algorithms (VQA)
* Quantum runtime systems and schedulers
