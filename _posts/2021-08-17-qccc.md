### Held in conjunction with the The 38th ACM International Conference on Supercomputing ([ICS24'](https://ics2024.github.io/index.html))
Kyoto, Japan, June 4 - 7, 2024.


### Overview
The past few years have seen tremendous development in quantum computing technology, remarked by the demonstra- tion of quantum supremacy. Although many quantum algo- rithms declare exponential speedups over their classical coun- terparts, today’s quantum devices in the noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era are very susceptible to environmen- tal noise, internal interference, manufacturing imperfection, and technology limitations. Consequently, quantum algorithms that are more robust to noise, or can be effectively decomposed into small pieces for incremental or parallel execution on NISQ devices become promising.

The purpose of this workshop is to explore innovative ways of quantum-classical cooperative computing (QCCC) to make quantum computing more effective and scalable in NISQ platforms. The workshop will focus heavily on how classical computing can improve NISQ device execution efficiency, scalability, or compensate for noise impact or technology defi- ciency, with particular emphasis on demonstrable approaches on existing NISQ platforms, such as IBM-Q, IonQ and Rigetti.

### Abstract

The rise of hardware accelerators and machine learning has led to unprecedented computational prowess. These technologies have been drivers of scientific research and discovery where the embarrassingly parallel nature of certain workloads are exploited to attain substantial improvements in time-to-solution and output quality across many fields of science. Despite the successes, there still exist an array of problems that appear to be manifestly intractable with classical computation alone; for which classical computation provides only approximate solutions or are otherwise computationally inefficient with respect to scalability.

An emerging technology that shows promise to address such problems is quantum computing, wherein algorithms exploiting quantum mechanical phenomena can achieve exponential gains in time and space for certain classes of problems. However, quantum workloads require significant classical computing support for preprocessing, including optimization and compilation, and postprocessing. This naturally leads to the concept of Quantum-centric Supercomputing (QCSC): the integration of quantum computational devices and high performance computing (HPC) resources. QCSC will leverage quantum and classical computing devices to enable execution of parallel and asynchronous workloads, unlocking capabilities for computations beyond what is currently possible.

In this talk, we will give an overview of our development roadmap and show how QCSC naturally fits this vision. We will explore ways in which the community can benefit from QCSC systems through detailed use cases suitable for such platforms that will play a central role in novel supercomputing systems of the future.

### Speaker Bio

Dr. Pascuzzi received his PhD in Physics from the University of Toronto, Canada in 2019. Following graduation,  he joined the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s Physics Division as a postdoctoral research fellow,  working on performance portability for high energy physics applications and quantum error mitigation. In  2021, Dr. Pascuzzi moved to Brookhaven National Laboratory as Assistant Computational Scientist, where  he focused on workflow systems and performance portability for high performance computing. He was a co-  recipient of a Department of Energy Office of Science Advanced Scientific Computing Research Exploratory  Research for Extreme-Scale Science award for “Novel Quantum Algorithms from Fast Classical Transforms.”  Dr. Pascuzzi joined IBM Research as a Quantum Compilation Engineer in 2022. In addition to compiler  development, his research includes quantum simulations for high energy physics and programming models  targeting Quantum-centric Supercomputing systems.
