### Held in conjunction with the The 32nd International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing ([HPDC23'](https://www.hpdc.org/2023/))
Orlando, Florida, United States, June 16 - 23, 2023, part of [FCRC 2023](https://fcrc.acm.org/)


### Overview
The past five years have seen tremendous development in quantum computing technology, remarked by the demonstration of quantum supremacy. Although many quantum algorithms declare exponential speedups over their classical counterparts, today's quantum devices in the noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era are very susceptible to environmental noise, internal interference, manufacturing imperfection, and technology limitation. Consequently, quantum algorithms that are more robust to noise, or can be effectively decomposed into small pieces for incremental or parallel quantum execution become promising.  

The purpose of this workshop is to explore innovative ways of quantum-classical cooperative computing (QCCC) to make quantum computing more effective and scalable in NISQ platforms. The workshop will focus heavily on how classical computing can improve NISQ device execution efficiency, scalability, or compensate for noise impact or technology deficiency, with particular emphasis on demonstrable approaches on existing NISQ platforms, such as IBM-Q, IonQ and Rigetti.

### Abstract

Quantum computers can solve important problems that are beyond the capability of conventional computers. Quantum computing is at an inflection point where small systems with a few dozen qubits have been demonstrated and the number of qubits is expected to increase to several thousand over the coming years. As qubits are low-energy devices, they are susceptible to high error-rates (in the range of 0.1% to 1% per operation). Unfortunately, quantum error-correction incurs a significant overhead (dozens/hundreds of physical qubits per fault-tolerant qubit) and is impractical for near-term machines. Therefore, hardware errors will continue to severely restrict the length of the program that can be reliably executed on a near-term quantum computer. In this talk, I will offer a computer-systems perspective of quantum computers and then share some of our recent work that improves the reliability of near-term quantum computers with intelligent software techniques. I will also discuss the hardware support necessary to enable large- scale quantum computers.
